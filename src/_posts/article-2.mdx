# Restoring Dignity Through Clean Water

Access to clean water is a fundamental right...


Good governance is more than a policy—it's a principle, a daily practice, and a national mindset.  
It answers two key questions: **Why does Haiti need it now more than ever? And how can it be achieved in practical, lasting ways?**

### Why?

- Haiti has endured decades of instability, mismanagement, and broken trust.
- Citizens are disconnected from institutions that should protect and serve them.
- Corruption and lack of transparency have crippled development.

Without governance that is **accountable**, **inclusive**, and **responsive**, no infrastructure, no program, and no international aid will endure.

### How?

Nouvo Ayiti 2075 proposes a *people-first*, *project-based* approach:
- Local leadership training rooted in integrity and civic responsibility.
- Community-driven councils to ensure transparency and feedback.
- Digital tools for real-time tracking of development milestones.
- Open communication between decision-makers and the people they serve.

Good governance begins with accountability—and it flourishes with **participation**.

> “Leadership is not about control. It’s about service and vision.” — Nouvo Ayiti 2075 Charter

Let this be a call: not only to critique what’s broken, but to **co-create what’s possible**.
