Kiawel Daniel: A Visionary Leader for a New Haiti

Kiawel Daniel is a Haitian entrepreneur, community builder,
and forward-thinking statesman whose life’s work reflects a deep commitment to
national renewal, social justice, and sustainable development. With academic
credentials in both Business Administration (MBA) and Law, Daniel combines
strategic thinking with legal rigor to address the foundational challenges
facing modern Haiti.

A self-made businessman, Daniel has successfully launched
and managed enterprises in sectors ranging from agriculture and logistics to
education and local manufacturing. His ventures are not only economically
viable but socially rooted—aimed at job creation, youth empowerment, and
revitalizing local economies. His business philosophy centers on ethical
entrepreneurship and investing in Haitian potential.

What distinguishes Daniel is his unique ability to bridge
divides. In times of national polarization, he has consistently brought
together voices from civil society, the diaspora, grassroots organizers, and
faith leaders. His approach is grounded in dialogue, unity, and collective
responsibility. This capacity to unite divergent groups around a shared vision
has earned him wide respect as a man of peace and principle.

Daniel’s vision for Haiti is bold yet grounded: a secure,
sovereign, and sustainable nation that values its people as its greatest asset.
He champions reforms in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and
environmental resilience, always linking them back to human dignity. For him,
rebuilding Haiti is as much about restoring trust and moral leadership as it is
about cement and steel.

Daniel is currently based in the United States, where he
serves as a cabinet-level advisor to former U.S. President Donald J. Trump. His
proximity to global leadership and policy environments further enriches his
capacity to act as a bridge between Haiti and international allies.

Personally, Daniel is deeply reflective. A lover of history
and philosophy, he finds balance in music—kompa, jazz, and classical—and
reconnects with his roots through nature hikes in the Haitian countryside. He
is fluent in French, Haitian Creole, English, and Spanish, making him an
effective communicator on both the local and global stage.

Kiawel Daniel is not just a man of vision; he is a man of
action, compassion, and unwavering dedication. Whether through business,
community service, or thought leadership, he represents the kind of
transformative energy Haiti urgently needs.

If leadership is about lifting others, Daniel has spent his
life doing just that—quietly, steadily, and with fierce love for his homeland.
