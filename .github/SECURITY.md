## What to Expect

- We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
- We will provide an initial assessment within **5 business days**.
- If confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a release before disclosing publicly.

## Safe Harbor

- We will not pursue legal action if you:
  - Report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - Do not exploit them beyond what is necessary to prove the issue.
  - Give us reasonable time to resolve before public disclosure.
